# Product Person

*What type of product person are you?*

This is an interactive tool based on *[What you should be looking for in a product person](https://medium.com/swlh/what-you-should-be-looking-for-in-a-product-person-ee40e39a7301)* by [Uri Haramati](https://twitter.com/uriharamati). You can use it to explore your own product passions or to help evaluate candidates. [Try it now!](https://montoya.github.io/product-person/) You are also welcome to take this code, build on it, and make cool things with it. (License is CC BY-NC, so if you want to do something commercial with it, please let me know.)

**I am currently looking for work**, ideally a product management position in the NJ/NY area or remote. Have a look at my [résumé](http://christianmontoya.net/montoya_resume_web.pdf) if you like.

Thanks to Uri Haramati, [Eli Grey](https://github.com/eligrey/), and the [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) team for making this quick project possible.
